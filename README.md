# The Flying Dragons

This piece of software will take in a video of you running, process and analyze it. Then it'll give you feedback to improve your running form. It will tell you what you are doing wrong and then tell you how to fix it. The feedback will be advice in the form of words or excercises with visual examples. It will include an easy to use gui.

# Introduction
F.A.R.T or Form Analyzer Running Tool is a Form running analying app.For this project, We plan to make a tool that helps users achieve/improve their running form through a range of interactive features. We hope to help athlets improve their running form without having to worry about needing a coach with them. Showing the user problems that they may miss watching videos of themselves or a small thing a coach won't pick up on. F.A.R.T wants to provide you the best of both worlds. Giving you the help and tips of the small things and giving examples of excersies to you help proform better. We aim to provide an intuitive user experience where individuals can input a video of them running and receive assorted visual feedback of their running. The app will support various methods for goal-setting and tracking, offering features such as a joint tracker to monitor joint health and flexibility, especially useful for tracking recovery from injuries or improving mobility. An Exercise Library that generates stretches tailored to the userâ€™s imported video to address the lack of mobility or potential weaked muscle group. This can also help prepare the body for physical activity and reduce the risk of injury. A Video library that gives the user the ability to look back that their previous imported videos.
