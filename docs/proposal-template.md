# Introduction

For this project, our goal is to create a wellness app that helps users achieve their personal objectives through a range of interactive features. We aim to provide an intuitive user experience where individuals can input their specific goals and receive a tailored plan to achieve them. The app will support various methods for goal-setting and tracking, offering features such as:

* Joint tracker - A tool to monitor joint health and flexibility, especially useful for tracking recovery from injuries or improving mobility.
* Calorie counter - A feature to track daily calorie intake, helping users stay on top of their dietary goals.
* Food suggestions - Personalized recommendations for meals and snacks based on the user's dietary preferences, nutritional needs, and goals.
* Warm-up sessions - Guided warm-up routines to prepare the body for physical activity, reducing the risk of injury.
* Meal plan creator - A customizable tool that allows users to create balanced meal plans aligned with their fitness or wellness objectives.
* Exercise plan creator - A feature that generates personalized workout plans tailored to the userâ€™s fitness level, goals, and preferences.

# Anticipated Technologies

We will use Python for backend development, Google Analytics for user tracking, nutrition and exercise databases. Testing frameworks, payment integration, user interface and push notifications.

# Method/Approach

Our development approach will follow an agile methodology. The project will be divided into smaller, manageable tasks, allowing us to focus on one feature at a time. This will ensure that each part of the project is built, tested, and refined progressively, with regular adjustments based on feedback and testing results.
We will meet in person or via Zoom for the planning and development of the project, in addition to individual work at home. All team members will take turns developing code, tests, and documentation to provide learning opportunities for everyone in different areas.
