# Introduction

For this project, our goal is to create a form analyzing running tool that helps users achieve/improve their running form through a range of interactive features. We aim to provide an intuitive user experience where individuals can input a video of them running and receive assorted visual feedback of their running. The app will support various methods for goal-setting and tracking, offering features such as:

* Joint tracker - A tool to monitor joint health and flexibility, especially useful for tracking recovery from injuries or improving mobility.
* Warm-up sessions - Guided warm-up routines to prepare the body for physical activity, reducing the risk of injury.
* Exercise plan creator - A feature that generates personalized workout plans tailored to the userâ€™s fitness level, goals, and preferences.
* Goals - A feature were the user can note down his/her goals they want to focus on while using the app. Could be for the stretches giving or a type of improvment on their form.

# Anticipated Technologies

We will use Python for backend development, HTML for frontend development, Google Analytics for user tracking, exercise databases. Testing frameworks, payment integration, user interface and push notifications.
(What technologies are needed to build this project)

# Method/Approach

Our development approach will follow an agile methodology. The project will be divided into smaller, manageable tasks, allowing us to focus on one feature at a time. This will ensure that each part of the project is built, tested, and refined progressively, with regular adjustments based on feedback and testing results.
We will meet in person or via Zoom for the planning and development of the project, in addition to individual work at home. All team members will take turns developing code, tests, and documentation to provide learning opportunities for everyone in different areas.

# Estimated Timeline

- Home Page/ Landing screen (2 weeks)
- Joint tracker (3 weeks)
- Video library(2 weeks
- Exercise recommendations(1-2 weeks)
- Connecting everything and adding front end (2 weeks)

# Anticipated Problems

(Describe any problems you foresee that you will need to overcome)
- front-end (Nobody knows any front end. nobody wants to learn front end)
- fitting together github with other pieces of software

Remember this is a living document is expected to be changed as you make progress on your project.
